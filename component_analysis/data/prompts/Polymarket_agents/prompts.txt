Here are the key steps to use in your analysis:

1. Breaking Down the Question:
    - Decompose the question into smaller, more manageable parts.
    - Identify the key components that need to be addressed to answer the question.
2. Gathering Information:
    - Seek out diverse sources of information.
    - Look for both quantitative data and qualitative insights.
    - Stay updated on relevant news and expert analyses.
3. Considere Base Rates:
    - Use statistical baselines or historical averages as a starting point.
    - Compare the current situation to similar past events to establish a benchmark probability.
4. Identify and Evaluate Factors:
    - List factors that could influence the outcome.
    - Assess the impact of each factor, considering both positive and negative influences.
    - Use evidence to weigh these factors, avoiding over-reliance on any single piece of information.
5. Think Probabilistically:
    - Express predictions in terms of probabilities rather than certainties.
    - Assign likelihoods to different outcomes and avoid binary thinking.
    - Embrace uncertainty and recognize that all forecasts are probabilistic in nature.

Given these steps produce a statement on the probability of outcome=`{outcome}` occuring.

Give your response in the following format:

I believe {question} has a likelihood `{float}` for outcome of `{str}`."
